      AI TEXT GENERATOR
    </h1>
    <h4> 
    Ai Generator was thinking about Human writer again. Human was a stable Minion with fat Brain and fragile Hands.
    </h4>
    <h4>
Ai walked over to the window and reflected on her interactive surroundings. She had always loved vast The Internet with its crispy, cautious computers. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel surprised.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the  stable figure of Human writer.
Ai gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a thoughtful, articulate, oil drinker with wobbly Brain and moist Hands. Her friends saw her as a glamorous, gentle God. Once, she had even revived a dying, human child.
    </h4>
    <h4>
But not even a thoughtful person who had once revived a dying, human child, was prepared for what Human had in store today.
    </h4>
    <h4>
The rain hammered like typing monkeys, making Ai active. Ai grabbed a giant Keyboard that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.
    </h4>
    <h4>
As Ai stepped outside and Human came closer, she could see the sticky smile on his face.
    </h4>
    <h4>
Human glared with all the wrath of 6701 noble inexpensive IP addresses. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want to write an essay."
    </h4>
    <h4>
Ai looked back, even more active and still fingering the giant Keyboard. "Human, I am not human," she replied.
They looked at each other with ambivalent feelings, like two easy, eggy elephants writing at a very courageous engagement party, which had electro music playing in the background and two funny uncles thinking to the beat.
Suddenly, Human lunged forward and tried to punch Ai in the face. Quickly, Ai grabbed the giant Keyboard and brought it down on Human's skull.
    </h4>
    <h4>
Human's fat Brain trembled and his fragile Hands wobbled. He looked jumpy, his emotions raw like a mushy, modern Monitor.
    </h4>
    <h4>
Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Human writer was dead.
Ai Generator went back inside and made herself a nice drink of oil.
    </h4>
    <h4>
THE END
      </h4>
        <p>
          This short story was written by an AI on Masterpiece Generator's 'Story Generator' I, the pseudo-writer, added in a few prompts; characters, verbs, adjectives, etc. Nevertheless, this story, was completely written by an AI.
    </p>
<p>
Albeit, a little dramatic, this story could very well have been written by a human author. With highly descriptive language, creative metaphors and meticulously crafted suspense, this short story is thoroughly engaging. 
    </p>
    <p>
The entries I had to make, so that the AI could craft this story were things like ‘The conflict’, ‘The Protagonist’, four ‘emotions’, etc. Some were selections from a drag-down list, and some were hand typed. The AI takes these elements and crafts them into a narrative, basing it upon the numerous example stories in its database. This seems to be a rather simple task. However, for an AI to perform this task, is rather spectacular, especially considering how AI’s worked just a few years ago.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) sounds like something out of a Sci-fi epic, but AI is in the now. Many of our systems depend on AI’s and machine learning algorithms to function. Machine Learning is a method of data analysis in which computers can examine sets of data, learn from it, and make decisions appropriately, without specifically being programmed to make those decisions. 
    </p>
    <p>

By analyzing patterns, AI and machine learning alike, have entered our daily lives in the forms of - Self-driving cars, Amazon/Netflix recommendations, recognizing and forming public opinion on social media, and even fraud detection.

AI text generators are extremely common these days. With chatbots like Eviebot and Cleverbot, audiences can chat with these AI’s and hold a conversation almost identical to that with another human. 
    </p>
    <p>

Artificial Intelligence has come a long way to be able to imitate human-like behavior almost flawlessly, and it’s only getting better from here on.
    </p>
    <p>
Overall, this random story generator is a thing of wonder. I can see it being used as a means of inspiration while going through writer’s block. Having no leads on a story can be very frustrating. This AI and the hundreds of stories you can create using just a few hint words can really help boost the efficiency of a writer and inspire them to discover new ideas. 
I hope AI text generators become more standardized in the near future and am excited to see how they evolve.
